# Stoneshard - More Save Slot

## Description

This mod adds more save slots, that's it. Vanilla allows 10 save slots, this mod 20.
While it's totally doable, this mod doesn't include any ini file to change the number of save slots available. If you want to change this value, you have to change line 19 of `MoreSaveSlot.cs` and recompile the mod thru MSL.

## Installation

Since this mod was made through MSL, you first need to install it and then patching the game with it.
You can follow the official [installation guide](https://dddddragon.github.io/ModShardLauncher/guides/how-to-play-mod.html) on the MSL documentation.

A [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J0oJYGi38E&t=13s&ab_channel=Nylux) was made by Nylux to show how to install Neoconsole, if you prefer a video guide.

### Installing MSL

- Download the latest release of [MSL](https://github.com/DDDDDragon/ModShardLauncher).
- Unzip it.
- **Move the `ModShard.dll` file to your Stoneshard folder.**
- (Optional) Rename the data.win file in the Stoneshard folder with an other name so you'll have a backup if something went wrong.

### Using MSL

- Download the latest `.sml` file released of [Stoneshard - MoreSaveSlot]().
- Move the `MoreSaveSlot.sml` in the `MSL/Mods` folder.
- Run `ModShardLauncher.exe`.
- Click on the anvil icon on the leftside.
- Click on the folder icon on the topside. A dialog box should pop up.
- Select the `.win` file in the Stoneshard folder (`data.win` if you didn't rename it).
- Enable the mod by checking the `Enable` box.
- Click the floppy disk icon on the topside. A dialog box should pop up.
- In this dialog box, create a new `.win` file and save (`data.win` if you didn't rename it).

You can now play the game with the modded version !

## Troubleshooting

If you encountered some troubles while trying to patch your game, first check if you **move the `ModShard.dll`** in the Stoneshard folder.

Then you can contact me on [Discord](https://discord.com/users/200330865522376704), and send me the latest log file found in `MSL/logs`.
